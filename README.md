# Blog WebApp

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Hello. This is a very simple blogging webapp that I created to learn more about Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
It uses dynamically generated webpages and a database hosted on MongoDB Atlas managed via an MVC model.
It includes basic user registration and login functions (with authentication and validation) and the ability for users to view posts and create new posts once they log in. I created this webapp while following through Greg Lim's book _Beginning Node.js, Express & MongoDB Development_.

### Built With

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Express](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)

## How to View

To run the code, you should clone the repository and run _node index.js_ in the terminal, after which you can view the app in localhost:4000. However, you would need to also set up and run a local MongoDB database and change the path in the file before your run it.

I also hosted this webapp on Heroku, so the easiest way to view it would be to visit https://shrouded-depths-64192.herokuapp.com or https://blog.danny-huang.com

Thanks for reading.
