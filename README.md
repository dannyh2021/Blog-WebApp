## About The Project

Hello. This is a very simple blogging webapp that I created to learn more about Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
It uses dynamically generated webpages and a database hosted on MongoDB Atlas managed via an MVC model.
It includes basic user registration and login functions (with authentication and validation) and the ability for users to view posts and create new posts once they log in.

### Built With

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
